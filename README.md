# Disassemble
A binary disassembler written in Java with [Capstone bindings](https://github.com/aquynh/capstone/tree/master/bindings/java)

MachO 64bit ABI support is in the works. Future plans include ELF and PE ABIs as well as lldb integration. Disassembling compiled text is made possible by the [Capstone project](http://www.capstone-engine.org/) and its Java bindings.

This project is still under heavy development, it does not even have an official name yet (just started on it). Feel free to fork and/or contribute.

Heres a screenshot of the working prototype. It is able to read and decompile basic Mach-O 64bit binaries
